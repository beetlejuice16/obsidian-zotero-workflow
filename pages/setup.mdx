## Background

I spent a long time trying to get a perfect setup for my vault and citations. The main goal was that I wanted to be able to access my sources on all my devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, phone), and be able to sync up the annotations/notes on the PDFs I was reading.

The biggest obstacle to getting a proper workflow going was reading newspaper artilces, blogs, or essays online. Basically, anything that doesn't automatically come with a formatted PDF to download. I didn't really know how to integrate that in my workflow as I wanted to be sure I would be able to annotate the content and then import it into my Zotero library.

I used [omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) for a while as it allows highlighting web articles and has an API that lets you import these highlights into obsidian. But, this turned out to be quite cumbersome as I eventually wanted to add them to my zotero library and would then end up with the articles being in two different places and requiring a lot of maintenance.

## Zotero

Zotero is a free and open-source "Reference management software". It manages your sources in the form of 'items', be that a journal paper, a book, or a book chapter and so on. These items can have attachments, the most important of which is usually a PDF of the content itself.

Zotero can organize your sources with _collections_ and _tags_. Collections act like folders and can have a hierarchy of subcollections. A source can exist in multiple collections, and a neat feature is being able to view the contents of a collections subcollections even when not openning the latter. The subcollections then work as a kind of filtering down of your view of the sources.

Tags are keywords you can assign to your sources to group them under a common theme. Each source can have multiple tags, and each tag can be attached to multiple sources. Tags also work across collections and can be used as a further means for categorization.

### Zotero Plugins

## Obsidian

Obsidian is a notetaking app that works on top of plaintext markdown files. It offers functionalities for linking, tagging, and adding various metadata to a note out of the box. It also comes with a 'graph view' that lets you visualize the connections between different notes you've taken.
