# Background

I spent a long time trying to get a perfect setup for my vault and citations. The main goal was that I wanted to be able to access my sources on all my devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, phone), and be able to sync up the annotations/notes on the PDFs I was reading.

The biggest obstacle to getting a proper workflow going was reading newspaper artilces, blogs, or essays online. Basically, anything that doesn't automatically come with a formatted PDF to download. I didn't really know how to integrate that in my workflow as I wanted to be sure I would be able to annotate the content and then import it into my Zotero library.

I used [omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) for a while as it allows highlighting web articles and has an API that lets you import these highlights into obsidian. But, this turned out to be quite cumbersome as I eventually wanted to add them to my zotero library and would then end up with the articles being in two different places and requiring a lot of maintenance.

Zotero is a "Reference management software". It is also free and open-source.
