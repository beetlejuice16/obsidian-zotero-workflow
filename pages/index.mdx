# Intro

Hello there. I spent a lot of time configuring a workflow for managing my non-fiction readings and note-taking in zotero and obsidian, and I hope I can help you start yours.

The reason it took me such a long time is because I am very particular about consistency and wanted to be able to have my workflow available on my desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone. This of course causes a lot of small issues, but I managed to get something working that fulfills most of my needs.

If this guide doesn't suit your needs a 100% I hope it serves as a starting point for you to get an idea on which direction you want to take your system in.
